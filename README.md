# BookAPI

Restful resource for requesting books

what is REST :-

    Rest stands for Representational state transfer.

    Rest has three constraints :-
    		client-server :- In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other.

    		Stateless:- Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa.

    		Cacheability :- clients and intermediaries can cache responses. Responses must therefore, implicitly or explicitly, define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from getting stale or inappropriate data in response to further requests
